# Neural Networks

Purpose : Estimating the strength of concrete for safer construction practices

Algorithm Implemented: Neural Networks

Project Overview: The goal is to build a model that could reliably predict concrete strength given a listing of the composition of the input materials.
These estimates are required in order to develop safety guidelines governing the materials used in the construction of buildings, bridges,
and roadways.
